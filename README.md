# Hello from the dev team! üëãüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Bulica is a bot designed by DJ Pixel to be an adventure into the world of the Discord API. After getting hosting sorted, Bulica is now ready to be released into the world, like some weird virtual Pokemon.


### Can I invite the bot?

Yes! You can use [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=772722250717331456&permissions=1979939943&scope=bot) link to invite the bot, or find a server with the bot in it and use the `+invite` command

### What is this bot?

This bot was made to be a public version of an old bot DJ Pixel and Church Dude made, Pixel's Slave. Pixel's Slave was made for one of DJ Pixel's old servers, Pixel HQ (can you see the theme going on here?), but was abandoned when the server had a rebrand to RYDE Records. Bulica was forgotten by the two boys until one day during the second wave of COVID in Australia got DJ Pixel just bored enough to revive it and fix the small bugs. 

### Self-hosting

Self-hosting is **not** recommended as you will not receive support if you manage to break the bot, you can use our code in accordance to the [license](https://github.com/Pixel-HQ-Bot-Development/bulica/blob/main/LICENSE). If you do want to use our source code, it will always stay open source and free!


### Got any questions?

If you have any further questions about this bot, its functionality or how to use this bot, you can find our support server [here](https://discord.gg/JE6kqwYsf9). If all fails, you can send a DM to DJ Pixel#0140 on discord and he will respond as soon as possible.
